# WobbleView

WobbleView is an implementation of a recently popular wobble effect for any view in your app. It can be used to easily add dynamics to user interactions and transitions.

## Installation

There are two options:

1. WobbleView is available via CocoaPods.
2. Manually add the files into your Xcode project. Slightly simpler, but updates are also manual.

## Usage

Just create a WobbleView and change its position.  

```
self.wobbleView.frame.origin = CGPoint(x: randomX, y: randomY)
```

or 

```
self.wobbleView.center = CGPoint(x: randomX, y: randomY)
```

or animate the viewâ€™s constraints.

## Properties

```
internal var frequency: CGFloat = 3
```

The frequency of oscillation for the wobble behavior.

```
internal var damping: CGFloat = 0.3
```

The amount of damping to apply to the wobble behavior.

```
var edges: ViewEdge = ViewEdge.Right
```

A bitmask value that identifies the edges that you want to wobble. You can use this parameter to wobble only a subset of the sides of the rectangle.

## Requirements

- iOS 7.0+
- Xcode 6.3
